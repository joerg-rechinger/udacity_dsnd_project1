## Installation

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.
For re-running the code, the 2019 data of the survey would have to be downloaded from [here](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019). Due to upload limits on git, I was not able to include the csv here as well.

## Project Motivation

For this project, I was using Stack Overflow data from 2019 to better understand:
  How is age of first coding experience different by continent?
  How is it different by the current age of the participants?
  Is there a difference of age of first coding experience by gender?


## File Descriptions

There is a jupyter notebook including all the code of my analysis. Moreover I included a python file mapping countries to continents that I found [here](https://gist.github.com/pamelafox/986163).


## Results

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@jrgrec/coding-start-them-young-b83cf760e9b4).
